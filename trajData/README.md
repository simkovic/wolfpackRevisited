Trajectory Data
--------------

npy is binary data format used to export [Numpy]<http://www.numpy.org/> matrices.

The darts/bugs trajectory coordinates are in [vp300]<https://github.com/simkovic/wolfpackRevisited/tree/master/trajData/vp300>. The same trajectories were used across all blocks/ all subjects. However the presentation order was randomized. Files with prefix 'order' give the trial order for each subject/block. The files with prefix 'chs' give the mouse coordinates. The coordinates are in degrees of visual angle referenced to 50 cm distance from the screen.
