* E2B1, E2B2, E2B3 - IPython Notebooks, document the analysis for block 1, 2, 3 with darts

* IndDif - IPython Notebook, documents the between blocks comparisons

HTML
--------

To make the access easier, we provide HTML export of the content of the IPython Notebooks

Python Code
----------

* Evaluation.py - contains functions used in the analyses

* Experiment.py - run the experiment and replay data

* Settings.py - settings for the experiment

* Constants.py - constants used by the experiment


Dependencies
-----------

=======

The code in this repository is meant as an documentation for the published research. The code has not been developed since the publication and may no longer work with the latest versions of its dependencies (such as Psychopy or PyStan). If you are interested in an maintained and (hopefully) up-to-date version of my code please have a look at the following repositories:

* [goal-directed motion toolkit](https://github.com/simkovic/GoalDirectedMotionToolkit) to create Stimuli and run Experiments

* [eyetracker](https://github.com/simkovic/eyetracking) to run Eyetracking experiments with Psychopy

* [matusplotlib](https://github.com/simkovic/matusplotlib/) to plot figures
